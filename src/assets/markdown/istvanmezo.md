### Why is it important?

Istvánmező, one of the neigbhourhoods of the 14th district of Budapest, was named after the last Palatine of Hungary, Archduke Stephen. The area was built in during the late 19th century when Budapest was growing in size to become a multicultural metropolis of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. The neighbourhood was known as the popular district of the nouveau riche who built their majestic villas here.

### What to do here?

Get off the bus and get lost in Istvánmező. Stroll along the streets and take a look at the villas from the turn of the 20th century. It’s like an open-air museum of late-19th, early 20th century architecture.

### Where to eat?

If you are hungry, you can eat

- at the modern bistro restaurant of A Kert Bisztró on Thököly Road,
- at the historic restaurant of Thököly Restaurant on Thököly Road,
- at the popular Stefánia Pizzeria and Restaurant on Thököly Road.

Or meet locals and have a drink at the popular and relaxed Tücsök Beer Garden on Stefánia! It’s very different from the crowded “ruin pubs” of downtown Budapest.
