### Why are they important?

**Tisztviselőtelep** (the Civil Servants’ Colony) and the Ganz Colony are 2 unique neighbourhoods in the heart of the city. Both were built in the last years of the Austro-Hungarian Empire but for different social classes. While the spacious, elegant Tisztviselőtelep was built for the middle class civil servants, the crowded Ganz Colony was built for the workers of the nearby Ganz Works. By visiting these 2 neighbourhoods, you can understand what life was like in the early 20th century for different social classes.

### How to get there?

Take metro line ![BKK M3 metro ikon](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Budapest_M3_Metro.svg "BKK M3 metro ikon") from Deák Ferenc tér metro station and get off at Nagyvárad tér metro station. Tisztviselőtelep is behind the tower of Semmelweis University. The Ganz Colony is in Vajda Péter Street.

### What to do here?

Get off the metro and get lost in Tisztviselőtelep and Ganz Colony. Stroll along the streets and take a look at the houses from the turn of the 20th century. It’s like a living museum of late-19th, early 20th century city life.

### Where to eat?

If you are hungry, dine at the restaurant of Hotel Gloria in Bláthy Ottó Street.
